This file is including or will include development logic and the proposed workflow of this project's development.

Basic Logic:
1: Use Leapfrop to implement a flow map Phi and Psi, given y, terminal asset price, as an input
2: Newton method to get the specific y such that Phi(y) = x0.
3: Plug this y back, get the real flow map we need, i.e, two vector, Phi(y), Psi(y) at each time point.
4: Integrate S0 using Phi(y) and Psi(y) we got before.


Implementation thoughts/ideas/log:

10 Sep, 2015: 
   Idea: We are going to repplicate the broken code in Matlab/Octave


21 Sep, 2015, Work to do:
   1: Add S1 term (Done)
   2: Create a function to check the solution
   3: Implement the utility functions
   4: It might be able to find a better way to initialize the parameters

21 Oct, 2015, work to do:
   Code to be edited:   
   1: Ham (done)
   2: Hp  (done)
   3: Hx  (done)
   4: lagr(done)
   5: Hxx (done)
   6: Hpp (done)
   7: Hxp (done)
   8: psi, general solution (changed the implementation)
   9: xi, particular solution (changed the implementation)
   10: strategy (done)

26 Oct, 2015. work to do:
   1: changed to the other way to implement nabla log function


02 Nov, 2015, questions for Andrew.
   1: what is the right time step to rebalance? (fixed time step? or some criterion when the phi deviate the optimal phi?)
   2: what is the right time horizon we need to use for the optimizer? the whole holding period? or just the rebalance time step?
   3: what is the right way to calibrate the underlying model parameters? what is the right way to get cleaned data? 


02 Jan, 2016, changes need to be made in paper without consumption.
   1: page 17, numerical test, add explanation the time consumption is for each thread, multi-thread can reduce the time for MC test
   2: page 21, top, we tracked PnL? Do we need to change into total wealth? or use cumulative return?
   3: page 21, Test on 10-asset portfolios, cumulative PnL
   4: page 18, specify L_max for all the plots generated
   5: create a form for all the parameters

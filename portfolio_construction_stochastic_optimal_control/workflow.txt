This file is including or will include development logic and the proposed workflow of this project's development.

Basic Logic:
1: Use Leapfrop to implement a flow map Phi and Psi, given y, terminal asset price, as an input
2: Newton method to get the specific y such that Phi(y) = x0.
3: Plug this y back, get the real flow map we need, i.e, two vector, Phi(y), Psi(y) at each time point.
4: Integrate S0 using Phi(y) and Psi(y) we got before.



### I am working on the below workflow organization.

Trial workflow:

For step 2:
#1: Approximation of gradient of Phit(y), input: vector y, 
2: Implement Newton which takes vector x, functions Ft(y) and Phit(y) as input, output vector y.

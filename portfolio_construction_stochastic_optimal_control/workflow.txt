This file is including or will include development logic and the proposed workflow of this project's development.

Basic Logic:
1: Use Leapfrop to implement a flow map Phi and Psi, given y, terminal asset price, as an input
2: Newton method to get the specific y such that Phi(y) = x0.
3: Plug this y back, get the real flow map we need, i.e, two vector, Phi(y), Psi(y) at each time point.
4: Integrate S0 using Phi(y) and Psi(y) we got before.


Implementation thoughts/ideas/log:

10 Sep, 2015: 
   Idea: We are going to repplicate the broken code in Matlab/Octave


21 Sep, 2015, Work to do:
   1: Add S1 term (Done)
   2: Create a function to check the solution
   3: Implement the utility functions
   4: It might be able to find a better way to initialize the parameters

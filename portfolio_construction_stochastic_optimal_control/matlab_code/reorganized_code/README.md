###Usage:
        Main function: wkbOptimizer
        Main test script: testScript
        You probably want to run the test script first. In this script, we set up two functions to compare the exact solution and the wkb approximation for LogNormal model and Mean Reverting Model. We also set up two sub script to run Mean Reverting and CIR model.

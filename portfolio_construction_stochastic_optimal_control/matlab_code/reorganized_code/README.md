###Usage:
        Main function: wkbOptimizer
        Main test script: testScript
        You probably want to run the test script first. In this script, we run two model. For lognormal, we compared the wkb approximation and the exact solution for three asset dimensions. For mean reverting, we calculate the 10 dimensions asset strategy.

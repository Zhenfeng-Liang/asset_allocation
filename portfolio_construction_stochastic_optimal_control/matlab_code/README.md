### Description:
        This file will include Matlab/Octave code which is replicating the original R code.

### Usage:
	Right now, we are testing the mean reverting model. So, don't run the lognormal model at this point. To run the script, go to the main script runOptimizer.m. If you want to change the asset price dimensions, make sure you also make the appropriate changes to MRMu, lambda, nVols, corrMatrix to make the dimensions consistent. ENJOY TO BE GETTING RICH!!!

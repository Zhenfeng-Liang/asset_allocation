## Description:
	This repository will include what I have done or am working on about Portfolio Construction. Details are as below.

### (1) Folder named asset_allocation_MPT_portfolio_challenge is including asset allocation script for portfolio challenge.
	
### (2) stochastic optimal control: including readings and the original broken R code. Waiting to be fixed. This might need to be reimplemented in python or C++ sometimes in the future.

### (3) Code for asset allocation and portfolio management. (This part is coming soon)
